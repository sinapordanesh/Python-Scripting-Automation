# Networking and Cybersecurity Scripts

Welcome to my repository of Python scripts focused on networking and cybersecurity. These scripts cover a wide range of concepts and techniques, and many of them are based on the book "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz. However, please note that the scripts also include my own modifications and enhancements.

## Disclaimer

**I do not claim ownership of the original book "Black Hat Python"**. All credit for the concepts and ideas goes to the author, Justin Seitz. The scripts in this repository are intended for educational and practical purposes, showcasing how the concepts discussed in the book can be applied and extended.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various networking and cybersecurity concepts. These scripts serve as practical examples and can be used to enhance your understanding of the subject matter. While they are inspired by "Black Hat Python", I have added my own modifications to adapt them to different scenarios and expand their functionality.

## Features

- **Networking**: Explore scripts related to network scanning, packet sniffing, port scanning, and more.
- **Web Exploitation**: Discover scripts for web scraping, exploiting vulnerabilities, and conducting web attacks.
- **Wireless Networks**: Learn about wireless network security with scripts for capturing packets, spoofing, and cracking WEP/WPA keys.
- **System Hacking**: Explore scripts for password cracking, privilege escalation, and remote administration.
- **Forensics**: Discover scripts for analyzing network traffic, extracting information from files, and conducting digital forensics investigations.
- **Security Tools**: Find scripts that implement security tools like VPNs, proxies, and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

## Usage

Each script is self-contained and can be executed individually. Before running any script, please ensure you have the necessary permissions and legal authorization to use it. It is crucial to use these scripts responsibly and ethically.

Please note that while these scripts have been tested and reviewed, they are provided as-is without any warranty. Use them at your own risk, and always exercise caution when working with security-related tools and techniques.

## License

The scripts in this repository are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). However, please be aware that the original book "Black Hat Python" has its own copyright and licensing terms, and you should refer to the book's official sources for any questions regarding its use and distribution.
