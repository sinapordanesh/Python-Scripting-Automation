# **SSH Tunneling**

SSH tunneling, or port forwarding, allows you to securely connect two computers by **forwarding traffic** from a local port on one computer to a remote port on another computer through an encrypted SSH tunnel. This can be done locally, remotely, or dynamically. Once set up, you can access the remote service as if it were running on your local computer, providing a secure way to access remote services and protect sensitive data.

- The Paramiko demo files include a file called `rforward.py` that does exactly this.
